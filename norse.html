He’s a relentless seeker of knowledge, having sacrificed his eye at Mimir’s well and hung himself from Yggdrasil to learn the secrets of the runes. Odin is often depicted with his spear Gungnir, and accompanied by his ravens Huginn and Muninn, who bring him news from across the realms. Though revered, Odin is complex — wise but manipulative, noble but willing to make grim sacrifices for the greater good.">
